The Poster examples that they gave us have three columns. The first column is a list (of important features?), the second column seems to be an
overall explanation of the system (or at least the major, interesting parts) while the third column could hold images or additional information
I figure we should plan out the poster first before we actually put it together. Below is a rough idea of how it could be put together. 

Column 1 - List 
(Heading) Major Features 
* Procedurally Generated Hex-Sphere 
* Local gravity + Player orientation 
* Algorithmic maze generation 
* First-person shooting mechanics 

Column 2 - 
(Sub-Heading 1) Hex-Sphere Design 
  A general explanation of the hex-sphere itself, and the technical challenges thereof 
  
 (Sub-Heading 2) - ? 
  Could talk about other interesting features, such as the maze generation, programming the player character, enemy pathfinding, etc. 
  
  Column 3 - Images or additional information 
  I think we could use this space to show off some of the interesting aspects of the project - we could show images of the hex-sphere, 
  the mazes, perhaps some of the models that we have created so far. 
  
  Once we agree on what the poster should look like, one of us can pop the 3 column template into photoshop or something and put it all 
  together.
